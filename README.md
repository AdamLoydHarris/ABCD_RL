# ABCD Recurrent Actor-Critic Network

This repository contains an implementation of a reinforcement learning agent that navigates a grid maze, receiving rewards in a specific sequence. 

The agent has a GRU layer before an actor and critic module. Trained on-policy using 40 interleaved example sequences.

<!-- The agent is trained using a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm with a Recurrent Actor-Critic network that includes a GRU layer.
